# Starting code for the guard scheduling application

Starting code for running a server using node, express and typescript. Jest and supertest for testing.

## Requirements:

You'll need an installation of node and npm on your system.

If you don't have these, please follow this guide: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

## Run Server:

These are written for someone running on unix/macOS, but you can reference the docs in the URL above for the windows commands.

1. cd to the `solution/typescript/code` directory.
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependancies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server. (this is all you need for the purpose of this assignment)
4. Navagate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello in your browser, and ensure you see "Hello World" displayed. If so you're good to go! If not please review these steps and send an email to me at alex@belfrysoftware.com to help!


## Tests:

1. Run `npm run test`
